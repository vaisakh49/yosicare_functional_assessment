Objective:
Create a functioning UI for login and user profile and implement necessary functionality
to achieve the result.
Steps for Completion:
● Create a react project and install Redux &amp; Router.
● Create a mock function that validates the provided username and password and
return the logged in user’s data. (Set one static user details)
● Create a login page and pass username password to the mock function to get
validated.
● Once validated the received user data should be stored in the redux store and
redirected to profile page using router.
● Create an user profile page that displays the user data from redux store that we
stored while login.

integration is properly implemented. Restrict the profile page if the user is not
logged in.
